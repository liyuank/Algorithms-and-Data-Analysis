Implementations of string-pattern matching and character matching algorithm.

1) To create a vector of several characters.


v <- c(“h”, “e”, “l”)


2) To have the user to enter any character to match which index's value, then display

the matching index#.

a_char <- readline(prompt="Enter a character: ")

charmatch(a_char, v)


3) To create a long string.

another <- “Today is Monday.”


4) To create a 3-character pattern (for example, like: Mon)

pattern <- “Mon”


5) To search and match which index # of the long string contains that pattern.

install.packages(“stringr”)

library(stringr)

str_locate(another, pattern)
